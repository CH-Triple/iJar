# iJar 📱⚙️

**iJar** is a native iOS app that allows you to run “.jar” (Java) programs directly on your iPhone with `iOS 18+` — something previously considered impossible due to iOS restrictions.

This app, developed by me, **chtriple**, uses advanced runtime techniques like `JIT` compilation to bridge the gap between Java and iOS.

## 🛠️ What does iJar do?

iJar is built to execute Java `.jar` files natively on iOS devices running iOS 18.0 or newer. It uses JIT to run Java bytecode, bypassing Apple's typical limitations on code execution. It's useful for testing, running lightweight Java applications, or just exploring what's technically possible on modern iOS hardware.

> iJar was developed purely for personal reasons. It's not certain whether I'll continue the project or not. But I might release a v2.0 version.
